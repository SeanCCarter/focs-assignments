Simplifying computation to recognizing strings in a language:

Alphabet: Sigma = {0,1}
string = 010, 0000, etc. "" = epsilon

language = defined set of strings
states: Q = {q0, q1, ... qn}
	- state q0 is almost always the starting state
	- accepting states {q1, ...1n}
	- transition table : {qk, x-> qm}
